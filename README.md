# plotly_deployment
## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to gather data about belly button bacteria from a json file and deploy it to an html file with different graphs representing different data.

## Analysis
There are four different items on the page that show information based the test candidate selected.

1. Demographic Info - Shows basic info about the candidate.
2. Bar Graph - This shows the top 10 bacteria found in descending order.
3. Bubble Graph - This shows all of the bacteria found in the candidate. The bubble colors represent the bacteria type and the bubble size represents amount of that bacteria found.
4. Gauge graph - This show the amount of times each candidate washes their belly buttons on a weekly basis.

## Formatting
Here are a list of formatting options I added to my page:
- Added an image to the jumbotron
- Changed the background color and the color of all the graphs
- Made the webpage mobile-responsive
- Changed the paragraph text under the first header to bold font.
